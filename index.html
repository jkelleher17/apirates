<h3>
<a id="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h3>

<p>Our group was quickly drawn to real estate analytics due to the media frenzy surrounding gentrification. Each of us has spent our summers in New York, San Francisco, and Boston, where housing prices are currently exploding, leaving many locals unable to afford to live in the houses they grew up in.</p>

<p>With the advent of gentrification in areas like Williamsburg in Brooklyn or the Mission District in San Francisco, we have seen housing prices rise and neighborhoods’ change their character. As mostly wealthy, white and educated people move in, we observe the neighborhood landscape change. Pondering on the static nature of gentrification and housing prices, our group sought out to use data science in order to analyze the various factors that influence housing prices.</p>

<p>The graph below depicts the median price per square foot, by zip code. It is clear that there exists a concentration of expensive homes. We begin our investigation with the hypothesis that home sales in similar locations will move in similar directions. That is; external factor about where a school is located (such as education, crime, hospitals, etc.) as well as nearby homes sales influence the value of a home.</p>

<ol>
<li>How do demographic variables affect future real estate prices?</li>
<li>Defining classifiers in order to predict what tax class a property will be in.</li>
<li>Testing those classifiers in order to find which model is best for our predictions.</li>
<li>To tackle a new topic, which we’ve had little practice in by applying a Bayesian regression to our dataset.</li>
</ol>

<a id="approach" class="anchor" href="#approach" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Approach</h3>

<p>We began our analysis by pulling data from the American Community Survey as well as datasets on every real estate sale in New York City. Through these two sources, we were able to acquire demographic data by zip code as well as sale price by zip code. After aggregating and cleaning our data, we engaged in exploratory visual analysis in order to recognize patterns in the data, which helped us with our analysis. One important discovery we made was that we were dealing with highly skewed data, which was not normally distributed. This helped inform our subsequent approaches when building our regression and classification models. In order to examine the relationship between housing prices and demographics, we utilized several different approaches including linear regression, Bayesian regression, and Bayesian linear regression, as well as a Support Vector Machines Classifier and a Naive Bayes Classifier.

<h3>
<a id="analysis" class="anchor" href="#analysis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analysis</h3>

<p>The first portion of the analysis performs two elastic net regressions: one on untransformed, unstandardized data; one on transformed, standardized data. The second elastic regression was a more powerful predictor. It's results are as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkelleher17/apirates/master/Reg2.png"></p>

<p>Afterwards, we attempted to classify the homes sales into Tax Class. Each home falls into one of three Tax Class, but about 83 percent of our points were categorized as tax class 1. This meant our data was largely skewed towards one tax class. If a classifier were to predict that every building sold was of tax class 1, then it would seem as if we succeeded. Knowing that our data is skewed, we know to think twice when judging how good our classifier is based on accuracy alone.</p>

<p>Our classifiers were largely successful in predicting the tax class of a property. After comparing our two classifiers, it seemed that Naive Bayes Classifier performed better than the Support Vector Classifier. How the Naive Bayes Classifier improves upon the Support Vector Classifier is illustrated in the ROC curve below:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkelleher17/apirates/master/roc.png"></p>

<p>Interpreting this graph, we see that the Naive-Bayes Classifier (top) has fewer false positives for the same rate of true positives as the Support Vector Machine. Also, the area under the naive-bayes ROC curve is 0.68, which is greater than the area under the SVM ROC curve (0.55).</p>

<a id="future-work" class="anchor" href="#future-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Work</h3>

<p>Predicting home sale price is a notoriously difficult thing to do. Last August, The Washington Post published a piece on “How to predict rising home prices, neighborhood change, and gentrification” (Badger). This article notes how much of a “logistical nightmare” it is to try and get the data to perform this analysis (Badger). However, building permit data may be particularly useful. As more and more big datasets become available, we expect more analytical studies to be funded to try and predict gentrification and neighborhood change.</p>

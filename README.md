###Topic:
Predicting median sale price per zip code in New York City 

##Procedure:

Before beginning, the Data.zip file must be unzipped. All of the data is stored there, and the code requires it to be run. Please do not rename the 'Data' folder: the code expects this to be in the path. (Note 'Data' has been added to .gitignore so there's no worries about accidentially pushing it).

With the Data.zip unzipped, please begin with Book 1. This covers the data collection, cleaning and visualization. 
**Important** At the end of Book 1: the DataFrame is pickled as 'cleandf'. This file will be required for the other Books to run.

In the case that Book 1 fails, or something goes wrong with the pickel. There is a 'cleandf' pickle stored in Data.zip that can be used instead.
